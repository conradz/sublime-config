# Sublime Configuration

This is my [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com/2) user directory. To use this, clone the repository into the `User` directory in the packages folder (`C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages` on Windows). Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and run `Package Control: Upgrade/Overwrite All Packages` from the command pallete (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). This will install all the packages.
